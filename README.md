# RESTful web services 

1. Definition: 

        Representational State Transfer (REST) is a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints 
        to be used for creating Web services.

        For providing standards between computer systems on the web, making it easier for systems to communicate 
        with each other. REST-compliant systems, often called RESTful systems, are characterized by how they are 
        stateless and separate the concerns of client and server. 
         
2. Details

        In the REST architecture, clients send requests to retrieve or modify resources, 
        and servers send responses to these requests.
         
        In the REST architectural style, data and functionality are considered resources and 
        are accessed using Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs), typically links on the Web. 
        The resources are acted upon by using a set of simple, well-defined operations. 
        The REST architectural style constrains an architecture to a client/server architecture and is designed 
        to use a stateless communication protocol, typically HTTP. 
        In the REST architecture style, clients and servers exchange representations of resources 
        by using a standardized interface and protocol.

 3. Principles

        The following principles encourage RESTful applications to be simple, lightweight, and fast:
        • Resource identification through URI 
        • Uniform interface 
        • Self-descriptive messages 
        • Stateful interactions through hyperlinks
